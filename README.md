Sion Pritchard — Data Analyst Portfolio

 About Me
I’m a Psychology with Cognitive Neuroscience graduate with a strong foundation in scientific research, data analysis, and statistics.
Through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and self-driven SQL, Excel, and Power BI development, I’ve built hands-on experience turning raw data into actionable insights.

This portfolio showcases selected analytical projects demonstrating my ability to clean, explore, and visualize data using data analyst and data science techniques.
